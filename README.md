# Welcome to FSHL #

FSHL is a free, open source, universal, fast syntax highlighter written in PHP. A very fast parser performs syntax highlighting for few languages and produces a HTML output.

FSHL library is a simple, easy to use syntax highlighter. Its API provides only one method that is really need to highlight sources and three auxiliary methods to sets lexer and output mode.

FSHL core is very flexible and it is very easy to add new languages. Feel free to do so and do not forget to share them with the rest of the world.


## Installation ##

### Composer ###

FSHL is available as a [Composer](http://getcomposer.org) package.

To use FSHL in your project, you first need to create a `composer.json` file containing your project's dependencies.

```json
{
    "require": {
        "kukulich/fshl": "2.0.*"
    }
}
```

Then download Composer and install the project's dependencies.

```
curl -s http://getcomposer.org/installer | php
php composer.phar install
```

After the installation you can find the FSHL source files inside your project's `vendor/` directory and load them in your project along with all other dependencies through autoloader.

```php
<?php
require 'vendor/autoload.php';
?>
```


### PEAR ###

FSHL can be installed using the [PEAR Installer](http://pear.php.net/). This installer is the backbone of PEAR, which provides a distribution system for PHP packages, and is shipped with every release of PHP since version 4.3.0.

[The PEAR channel](http://pear.kukulich.cz/) that is used to distribute FSHL needs to be registered with the local PEAR environment.

```
pear channel-discover pear.kukulich.cz
```

This has to be done only once. Now the PEAR Installer can be used to install packages from the kukulich channel:

```
pear install kukulich/FSHL
```

After the installation you can find the FSHL source files inside your local PEAR directory.


## Example ##

```php
<?php
$highlighter = new \FSHL\Highlighter(new \FSHL\Output\Html());
$highlighter->setLexer(new \FSHL\Lexer\Php());
echo '<pre>';
echo $highlighter->highlight('<?php echo "Hello world!"; ?>');
echo '</pre>';
?>
```

Or

```php
<?php
$highlighter = new \FSHL\Highlighter(new \FSHL\Output\Html(), \FSHL\Highlighter::OPTION_TAB_INDENT | \FSHL\Highlighter::OPTION_LINE_COUNTER);
echo '<pre>';
echo $highlighter->highlight('<?php echo "Hello world!"; ?>', new \FSHL\Lexer\Php());
echo '</pre>';
?>
```

### Stylesheet ###

A nice default stylesheet is located in the `style.css` file.


## Requirements ##

FSHL requires PHP 5.3 or later.
